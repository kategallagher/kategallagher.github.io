		Hi!  My name is Kate Gallagher.  I'm 24 years old and have spent 11/12 of my life in MA.  I love to make all kinds of things and go on adventures.  I also don't take many pictures of my own face, so this photo is about 3 years old and inexplicably (OK, explicably, but later) while dressed as a leprechaun.
