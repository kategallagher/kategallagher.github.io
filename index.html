		Hi!  My name is Kate Gallagher.  I'm 24 years old and have spent 11/12 of my life in MA.  I love to make all kinds of things and go on adventures.  I also don't take many pictures of my own face, so I'm at the mercy of my friends who think it's funny when I try to avoid sunburn.  I have a background in Studio Art and Psychology, as well as a few years' experience in the legal world of Manhattan (no thank you).  I'm really looking forward to this course and learning all about a new medium!
